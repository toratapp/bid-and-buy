Noroff school assignment, Front-end development. The assignment was to design and build a website for an online auction site.


## Description

Bid and buy is an auction site where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction. A registered user may login, logout, update their avatar, view their total credit, create listings, bid on other user's listings and view bids on listings. Unregistered users may view and search through listings. Target audience: Men and women 25-55 who like the excitement of bidding and winning auctions. In this assignment I practiced using some of the methods one can use when connecting to an API: GET, POST and PUT.


## Built With

- HTML
- SASS
- CSS Framework: Bootstrap v5.3
- JavaScript
- [Noroff Auction house API](https://docs.noroff.dev/auctionhouse-endpoints/authentication)


## Installing and running
